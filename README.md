Intro

Pending Update to Profile in Progress (as of 6/05/2024)

Day 1 (6/5/2024): 

Scenario: A small startup (Banana) is trying to build its network infrastructure to eventually be able to scale up one day to be the best Tech company in the world.  Below is my update as I make tweaks and edit every day using Cisco Packet Tracer utilizing what I learn from obtaining my CCNA and continued self-education to build out the Diagram of this network topology.

Note: So far, the notes I leave will be very brief and not as full-out and fleshly Documented as I'm still working on building out this project.


We will start off using a Class C Network of Private IP Ranges: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.  Since Banana HQ is a startup, we don't anticipate needing more than 254 hosts OR in other words, devices for our network in particular.
